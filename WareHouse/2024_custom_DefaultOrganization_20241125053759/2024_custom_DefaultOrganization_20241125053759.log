Given the nature of the task, which is to design a simple 2048 game with a 10*10 grid, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the game visually and interactively, providing the user with a functional and engaging experience. What are your thoughts on this?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a simple 2048 game with 10*10 grids..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Design a simple 2048 game with 10*10 grids.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To design a simple 2048 game with a 10x10 grid using Python, we will use the Pygame library for the graphical user interface. Here is the plan for the core classes and functions:

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **Game**: 
   - Manages the game state, including the grid and score.
   - Methods: `__init__`, `reset`, `move`, `add_random_tile`, `is_game_over`.

2. **Tile**:
   - Represents a single tile in the grid.
   - Methods: `__init__`, `merge`.

3. **GUI**:
   - Handles the graphical user interface using Pygame.
   - Methods: `__init__`, `draw_grid`, `draw_tiles`, `handle_input`, `update_display`.

4. **Main**:
   - Initializes the game and GUI, and contains the main game loop.

### File Structure

1. `main.py`: Contains the main game loop and initializes the game.
2. `game.py`: Contains the `Game` class.
3. `tile.py`: Contains the `Tile` class.
4. `gui.py`: Contains the `GUI` class.

Let's implement the code for each file:

#### main.py

```python
'''

Main file to initialize and run the 2048 game with a 10x10 grid.

        gui.update_display()
        if game.is_game_over():
            running = False
    
    pygame.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":

            self.grid[i][j] = Tile(2 if random.random() < 0.9 else 4)

    def move(self, direction):
        # Implement movement logic here
        pass

    def is_game_over(self):
        # Implement game over check here

Unimplemented File:
"game.py"
In our software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all methods in the game.py file which contains a unimplemented class. Now, implement all methods of the game.py and all other codes needed, then output the fully implemented codes, strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a simple 2048 game with 10*10 grids..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a significant issue with the GUI scaling. The grid size is set to 10x10, but the GUI dimensions are hardcoded to 600x600 pixels, with each tile being 60x60 pixels. This results in only a 10x10 grid fitting perfectly, but it doesn't account for the possibility of resizing or adapting to different screen sizes. Additionally, the tile size calculation should be dynamic based on the grid size to ensure proper scaling.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
The GUI dimensions and tile sizes are hardcoded, which may not adapt well to different screen sizes or grid sizes. This could lead to display issues if the grid size or screen resolution changes.

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. **Dynamic Tile Size Calculation**: Calculate the tile size dynamically based on the grid size and screen dimensions. This will ensure that the tiles fit perfectly within the screen regardless of the grid size.

2. **Flexible Screen Dimensions**: Allow the screen dimensions to be adjustable or calculated based on the grid size and desired tile size to maintain a consistent appearance.

3. **Update the `GUI` Class**:
   - Modify the `__init__` method to calculate the tile size dynamically.
   - Adjust the `draw_grid` method to use the calculated tile size for drawing tiles.

### Example Code Revision:
```python
class GUI:
    def __init__(self, game):
        self.game = game
        self.width = 600
        self.height = 600
        self.tile_size = self.width // self.game.size
        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((self.width, self.height))
        self.font = pygame.font.SysFont("Arial", 24)

    def draw_grid(self):
        for i in range(self.game.size):
            for j in range(self.game.size):
                tile = self.game.grid[i][j]
                x, y = j * self.tile_size, i * self.tile_size
                if tile:
                    pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, (255, 255, 255), (x, y, self.tile_size, self.tile_size))
                    text = self.font.render(str(tile.value), True, (0, 0, 0))
                    self.screen.blit(text, (x + self.tile_size // 3, y + self.tile_size // 3))
                else:
                    pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, (200, 200, 200), (x, y, self.tile_size, self.tile_size))
```

By implementing these changes, the application will be more robust and adaptable to different grid sizes and screen resolutions.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a significant issue with the GUI scaling. The grid size is set to 10x10, but the GUI dimensions are hardcoded to 600x600 pixels, with each tile being 60x60 pixels. This results in only a 10x10 grid fitting perfectly, but it doesn't account for the possibility of resizing or adapting to different screen sizes. Additionally, the tile size calculation should be dynamic based on the grid size to ensure proper scaling.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
The GUI dimensions and tile sizes are hardcoded, which may not adapt well to different screen sizes or grid sizes. This could lead to display issues if the grid size or screen resolution changes.

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. **Dynamic Tile Size Calculation**: Calculate the tile size dynamically based on the grid size and screen dimensions. This will ensure that the tiles fit perfectly within the screen regardless of the grid size.

2. **Flexible Screen Dimensions**: Allow the screen dimensions to be adjustable or calculated based on the grid size and desired tile size to maintain a consistent appearance.

3. **Update the `GUI` Class**:
   - Modify the `__init__` method to calculate the tile size dynamically.
   - Adjust the `draw_grid` method to use the calculated tile size for drawing tiles.

### Example Code Revision:
```python
class GUI:
    def __init__(self, game):
        self.game = game
        self.width = 600
        self.height = 600
        self.tile_size = self.width // self.game.size
        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((self.width, self.height))
        self.font = pygame.font.SysFont("Arial", 24)

    def draw_grid(self):
        for i in range(self.game.size):
            for j in range(self.game.size):
                tile = self.game.grid[i][j]
                x, y = j * self.tile_size, i * self.tile_size
                if tile:
                    pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, (255, 255, 255), (x, y, self.tile_size, self.tile_size))
                    text = self.font.render(str(tile.value), True, (0, 0, 0))
                    self.screen.blit(text, (x + self.tile_size // 3, y + self.tile_size // 3))
                else:
                    pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, (200, 200, 200), (x, y, self.tile_size, self.tile_size))
```

By implementing these changes, the application will be more robust and adaptable to different grid sizes and screen resolutions."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments.

However, there is a significant issue with the GUI scaling. The grid size is set to 10x10, but the GUI dimensions are hardcoded to 600x600 pixels, with each tile being 60x60 pixels. This results in only a 10x10 grid fitting perfectly, but it doesn\'t account for the possibility of resizing or adapting to different screen sizes. Additionally, the tile size calculation should be dynamic based on the grid size to ensure proper scaling.\n\n### Comment with Highest Priority:\nThe GUI dimensions and tile sizes are hardcoded, which may not adapt well to different screen sizes or grid sizes. This could lead to display issues if the grid size or screen resolution changes.\n\n### Suggestions on Revision:\n1. Dynamic Tile Size Calculation: Calculate the tile size dynamically based on the grid size and screen dimensions. This will ensure that the tiles fit perfectly within the screen regardless of the grid size.\n\n2. Flexible Screen Dimensions: Allow the screen dimensions to be adjustable or calculated based on the grid size and desired tile size to maintain a consistent appearance.\n\n3. Update the GUI Class*:\n   - Modify the __init__ method to calculate the tile size dynamically.\n   - Adjust the draw_grid method to use the calculated tile size for drawing tiles.\n\n### Example Code Revision:\npython\nclass GUI:\n    def __init__(self, game):\n        self.game = game\n        self.width = 600\n        self.height = 600\n        self.tile_size = self.width // self.game.size\n        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((self.width, self.height))\n        self.font = pygame.font.SysFont("Arial", 24)\n\n    def draw_grid(self):\n        for i in range(self.game.size):\n            for j in range(self.game.size):\n                tile = self.game.grid[i][j]\n                x, y = j * self.tile_size, i * self.tile_size\n                if tile:\n                    pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, (255, 255, 255), (x, y, self.tile_size, self.tile_size))\n                    text = self.font.render(str(tile.value), True, (0, 0, 0))\n                    self.screen.blit(text, (x + self.tile_size // 3, y + self.tile_size // 3))\n                else:\n                    pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, (200, 200, 200), (x, y, self.tile_size, self.tile_size))\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will be more robust and adaptable to different grid sizes and screen resolutions.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a simple 2048 game with 10*10 grids..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and follows the task requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `add_random_tile` method in the `Game` class. After each move, a new tile is added, but if the grid is full and no moves are possible, the game should end without adding a new tile. This logic is not currently implemented, which could lead to an error when trying to add a tile to a full grid.

**Suggestion for Revision:**

Before calling `add_random_tile()` in the `move` method, check if there are any empty tiles available. If there are no empty tiles and no possible merges, the game should end.

```python
def move(self, direction):
    # Existing slide logic
    ...
    # Check if any tiles were moved or merged
    if any(self.grid[i][j] is None for i in range(self.size) for j in range(self.size)):
        self.add_random_tile()
    elif self.is_game_over():
        print("Game Over!")
```

This ensures that a new tile is only added if there is space available, preventing any potential errors from trying to add a tile to a full grid.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured and follows the task requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `add_random_tile` method in the `Game` class. After each move, a new tile is added, but if the grid is full and no moves are possible, the game should end without adding a new tile. This logic is not currently implemented, which could lead to an error when trying to add a tile to a full grid.

**Suggestion for Revision:**

Before calling `add_random_tile()` in the `move` method, check if there are any empty tiles available. If there are no empty tiles and no possible merges, the game should end.

```python
def move(self, direction):
    # Existing slide logic
    ...
    # Check if any tiles were moved or merged
    if any(self.grid[i][j] is None for i in range(self.size) for j in range(self.size)):
        self.add_random_tile()
    elif self.is_game_over():
        print("Game Over!")

This ensures that a new tile is only added if there is space available, preventing any potential errors from trying to add a tile to a full grid."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a simple 2048 game with 10*10 grids..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code is mostly well-structured and follows the requirements, but there is a potential issue with the `move` method in the `Game` class. Specifically, the logic for reversing rows and columns when moving right or down could lead to unintended behavior if not handled correctly. The reversal should be done only for the purpose of sliding and should not affect the original grid structure. Here's how you can fix it:

### Comment with the Highest Priority:
Ensure that the reversal of rows and columns in the `move` method does not permanently alter the grid structure, which could lead to incorrect game logic.

### Suggested Revision:
Modify the `move` method to handle the reversal of rows and columns more carefully. Here's a revised version of the `move` method:

```python
def move(self, direction):
    def slide(row):
        new_row = [tile for tile in row if tile is not None]
        for i in range(len(new_row) - 1):
            if new_row[i].merge(new_row[i + 1]):
                self.score += new_row[i].value
                new_row[i + 1] = None
        new_row = [tile for tile in new_row if tile is not None]
        return new_row + [None] * (self.size - len(new_row))
    
    moved = False
    if direction in ('left', 'right'):
        for i in range(self.size):
            row = self.grid[i][:]
            if direction == 'right':
                row.reverse()
            new_row = slide(row)
            if direction == 'right':
                new_row.reverse()
            if new_row != self.grid[i]:
                moved = True
                self.grid[i] = new_row
    elif direction in ('up', 'down'):
        for j in range(self.size):
            column = [self.grid[i][j] for i in range(self.size)]
            if direction == 'down':
                column.reverse()
            new_column = slide(column)
            if direction == 'down':
                new_column.reverse()
            if new_column != column:
                moved = True
                for i in range(self.size):
                    self.grid[i][j] = new_column[i]
    
    if moved:
        self.add_random_tile()
```

This revision ensures that the grid is only temporarily reversed for sliding and then correctly restored, maintaining the integrity of the game logic.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and follows the requirements, but there is a potential issue with the `move` method in the `Game` class. Specifically, the logic for reversing rows and columns when moving right or down could lead to unintended behavior if not handled correctly. The reversal should be done only for the purpose of sliding and should not affect the original grid structure. Here's how you can fix it:

### Comment with the Highest Priority:
Ensure that the reversal of rows and columns in the `move` method does not permanently alter the grid structure, which could lead to incorrect game logic.

### Suggested Revision:
Modify the `move` method to handle the reversal of rows and columns more carefully. Here's a revised version of the `move` method:

```python
def move(self, direction):
    def slide(row):
        new_row = [tile for tile in row if tile is not None]
        for i in range(len(new_row) - 1):
            if new_row[i].merge(new_row[i + 1]):
                self.score += new_row[i].value
                new_row[i + 1] = None
        new_row = [tile for tile in new_row if tile is not None]
        return new_row + [None] * (self.size - len(new_row))
    
    moved = False
    if direction in ('left', 'right'):
        for i in range(self.size):
            row = self.grid[i][:]
            if direction == 'right':
                row.reverse()
            new_row = slide(row)
            if direction == 'right':
                new_row.reverse()
            if new_row != self.grid[i]:
                moved = True
                self.grid[i] = new_row
    elif direction in ('up', 'down'):
        for j in range(self.size):
            column = [self.grid[i][j] for i in range(self.size)]
            if direction == 'down':
                column.reverse()
            new_column = slide(column)
            if direction == 'down':
                new_column.reverse()
            if new_column != column:
                moved = True
                for i in range(self.size):
                    self.grid[i][j] = new_column[i]
    
    if moved:
        self.add_random_tile()
```

This revision ensures that the grid is only temporarily reversed for sliding and then correctly restored, maintaining the integrity of the game logic."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, the primary external library used in this project is `pygame`, which is used for creating the graphical user interface. Here is the `requirements.txt` file specifying the necessary dependency:
```
pygame==2.1.2
```
This version number is an example and should be adjusted based on the latest stable version available or the version you have tested the application with. You can check the installed version of `pygame` in your environment using the command `pip show pygame` to ensure compatibility. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# 2048 Game User Manual

Welcome to the 2048 Game! This manual will guide you through the installation, setup, and gameplay of the 2048 game with a 10x10 grid. This game is a simple yet addictive puzzle game where the objective is to combine tiles with the same numbers to reach the highest possible score.

## Main Functions

The 2048 Game includes the following main functions:

- **Grid Management**: The game features a 10x10 grid where tiles with numbers appear. You can slide these tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- **Tile Merging**: When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a single tile with the sum of their values.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of your score, which increases every time tiles merge.
- **Game Over Detection**: The game ends when there are no possible moves left.

## Quick Install

To get started with the 2048 Game, you need to install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Use `pip` to install the necessary Python packages.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install the `pygame` library, which is used for the graphical user interface.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the main script to start the game.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Game Controls**: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the tiles:
   - **Up Arrow**: Slide tiles up.
   - **Down Arrow**: Slide tiles down.
   - **Left Arrow**: Slide tiles left.
   - **Right Arrow**: Slide tiles right.

3. **Objective**: Combine tiles with the same numbers to create larger numbers and increase your score. The game ends when there are no more possible moves.

4. **Game Over**: When the game is over, a "Game Over!" message will be displayed in the console.

## Additional Information
