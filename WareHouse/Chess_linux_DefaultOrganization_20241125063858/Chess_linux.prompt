Design a chess game, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs (formal chess notation such as Ke8).
