# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This application allows two players to enjoy a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Main Functions

- **Two-Player Mode**: The game allows two players to take turns playing as 'X' and 'O'.
- **Winner Determination**: The game automatically checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
- **Graphical User Interface**: The game features a simple and intuitive GUI using the `tkinter` library.
- **Game Reset**: After a game concludes, the board resets automatically for a new game.

## Quick Install

To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, ensure that the `tkinter` library is available, which is typically included with standard Python installations.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Verify tkinter Installation**: `tkinter` is included with Python on most systems. You can verify its installation by running the following command in your Python environment:
   ```python
   import tkinter
   ```

3. **Download the Code**: Save the provided `main.py` code to your local machine.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located, and execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Game Interface**: A window will open displaying a 3x3 grid. This is the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

3. **Taking Turns**: Players take turns by clicking on the empty squares. Player 'X' starts the game.

4. **Winning the Game**: The game will automatically detect if a player has won or if the game ends in a draw. A message box will display the result.

5. **Restarting the Game**: After a game concludes, the board will reset automatically, allowing players to start a new game.

## Troubleshooting

- **GUI Issues**: If the GUI does not start, ensure that your system supports graphical interfaces and that you have a display environment available.
- **Error Messages**: If you encounter a `tkinter.TclError`, check your Python installation and ensure `tkinter` is properly installed.

Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe with your friends!
